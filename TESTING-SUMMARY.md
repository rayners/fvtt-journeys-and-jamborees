# Simple Worldbuilding Testing Summary

## Work Completed

### 1. Test Infrastructure ✅

- Created comprehensive Quench tests for Simple Worldbuilding system
- Added API exports for test access to system components
- Built module with all test updates

### 2. Test Documentation ✅

- Created detailed test plan (`TEST-PLAN-SIMPLE-WORLDBUILDING.md`)
- Created user guide for Simple Worldbuilding (`docs/simple-worldbuilding-guide.md`)
- Documented expected behaviors and limitations

### 3. Quench Test Suite ✅

Added automated tests for:

- System defaults and configuration
- GenericAdapter usage verification
- Skill detection from attributes
- Minimal system structure handling
- None skill option behavior
- Resource management display
- Absence of hardcoded Dragonbane references

## Ready for Testing

The module is now ready for manual testing with Simple Worldbuilding. The key areas to validate:

### Core Functionality

1. Module loads without errors
2. Party actors can be created
3. Characters can be added/removed
4. Travel roles can be assigned

### Skill System

1. Attributes are detected as skills (if present)
2. Settings show appropriate options
3. "None" skill option works properly
4. GenericAdapter handles missing data gracefully

### System Configuration

1. Movement defaults to 25/50 units
2. Time unit shows as "period"
3. No Dragonbane-specific content visible

### User Experience

1. Settings are clear and configurable
2. Error handling is graceful
3. Sheet functions properly

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Testing**: Run through the test plan in a Simple Worldbuilding world
2. **Run Quench Tests**: Execute the automated test suite
3. **Document Results**: Record any issues or unexpected behaviors
4. **Update Documentation**: Add any clarifications needed based on testing

## Test Execution Instructions

1. Create a new Simple Worldbuilding world
2. Enable Journeys & Jamborees and Quench modules
3. Create test characters with custom attributes
4. Open Quench UI and run "Simple Worldbuilding System Tests"
5. Follow the manual test plan for comprehensive validation

## Expected Outcome

The module should work seamlessly with Simple Worldbuilding's minimal structure, using generic defaults and allowing users to configure skills based on their custom attributes. The system should gracefully handle cases where no skills/attributes are defined.
