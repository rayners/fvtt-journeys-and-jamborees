## About

Journeys & Jamborees transforms how groups handle travel, resources, and party dynamics by treating the party as a cohesive unit with its own character sheet. Instead of juggling individual character inventories and tracking party resources across multiple sheets, J&J provides a unified Party actor that serves as the central hub for group activities.
