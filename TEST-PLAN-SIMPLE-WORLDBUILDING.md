- [ ] Movement settings can be changed
- [ ] Changes reflect in party sheet

#### 3.2 Dice Formulas

- [ ] Random encounter uses 1d20 (threshold 15)
- [ ] Weather roll uses 1d6
- [ ] Pathfinding uses 1d20
- [ ] Custom dice formulas can be configured

#### 3.3 No Hardcoded References

- [ ] No "BUSHCRAFT" text visible

- [ ] No Dragonbane-specific imagery
- [ ] Generic wilderness image used

### 4. User Experience Tests üë§

#### 4.1 Settings Interface

- [ ] All settings have clear labels
- [ ] Hints explain what each setting does

## Automated Test Execution

Run Quench tests for Simple Worldbuilding:

1. Open Quench UI (flask icon)
2. Find "Journeys & Jamborees" test section
3. Run "Simple Worldbuilding System Tests"
4. Verify all tests pass

## Expected Results
