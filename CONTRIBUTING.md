# Contributing to Journeys & Jamborees

> **Note**: This project is in early alpha and not currently accepting code contributions. This document outlines how you can help and what the future contribution process will look like.

## Current Status

Journeys & Jamborees is in active early development. The core architecture and feature set are still being established, which means:

- ❌ **Not accepting**: Pull requests for new features or refactoring
- ✅ **Accepting**: Bug reports
- ✅ **Accepting**: Testing feedback
- ⚠️ **Limited acceptance**: Feature suggestions (most features are already planned)

## How You Can Help Now

### 1. Report Bugs

If you encounter bugs while testing:

1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Create a new issue with:
   - Clear description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Your Foundry VTT version
   - Your Dragonbane system version
   - Any console errors (F12 in browser)

### 2. Test the Module

Once beta releases are available:

- Test with your gaming group
- Try different workflows
- Report what works and what doesn't
- Share your experience

### 3. Share Ideas (Carefully)

While the feature roadmap is largely planned, you can still share ideas:

- Check the README for planned features first
- Focus on user experience improvements
- Share creative uses you've found
- Suggest integration ideas with other modules

## Future Contribution Process

Once the module reaches beta status, we'll accept contributions following these guidelines:

### Code Style

- TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- Prettier for formatting (configuration coming)
- ESLint for code quality (configuration coming)
- Clear variable and function names
- Comments for complex logic

### Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests (when available)
5. Update documentation
6. Submit a pull request

### Commit Messages

- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
